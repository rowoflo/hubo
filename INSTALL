Installation Instructions
*************************

Pre-requisites: Hubo-Motion-RT (https://github.com/hubo/hubo-motion-rt) and hubo-ach (https://github.com/hubo/hubo-ach)


0. This package uses autotools. If you're not sure whether you have autotools, put the following
into the terminal:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf

____________________________________________________________

1. Now to use autotools:

In the directory which contains Makefile.am and configure.ac, run the following commands in
the terminal:

$ mkdir m4
(If it already exists, then don't worry about this step.)

$ autoreconf -i
(Give this some time. It can take a while.)

$ ./configure

This should generate a Makefile. You can use 

$ ls

from the terminal to check that "Makefile" exists.

____________________________________________________________

2. Now you're ready to compile. Try the following:

$ make
(If an error occurs here, please contact mxgrey@gatech.edu)

Possible issues:

 -- Cannot link to libhuboparams.so or error: hubo-jointparams.h: No such file or directory:
    Make sure to install the latest version of hubo-ach (which means running "$ git pull",
    "$ autoreconf -i", "$ ./configure", and "$ sudo make install" in your hubo-ach directory.

 -- Cannot link to libhuboctrl.so or libdaemonizer.so OR cannot find Hubo_Control.h: 
    Make sure to install the latest version of Hubo-Motion-RT. This package depends on it.

If you want to install the executables system-wide (so you can call them from the terminal in any
directory) use the following command:
$ sudo make install
(This will make the package system-wide and install the libraries)

____________________________________________________________

3. Everything should be ready to go.

If you try running the software according to the instructions in USAGE and you get something like
the following error:

"libhuboparams.so.x.x.x cannot be found" or "libdaemonizer.so.x.x.x cannot be found"

then the libraries were installed to a directory which is not in your ldconfig path. Feel free to
contact mxgrey@gatech.edu to figure out how to resolve the issue.

or compilation whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact the author.
